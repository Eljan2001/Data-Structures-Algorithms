Count the integers of the form 2^x  3^y
Find the count of integers from the range [a, b] that can be represented as 2x  3y (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0).

Input
Consists of no more than 106 lines. Each line contains two integers a and b (0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) that represents one query.

Output
For each query print in a separate line the number of integers from the range [a, b] inclusively that can be represented as 2x  3y.
